Hi. I'm Gengkun He, you can call me **Ahab**, and on most websites you can find me through ahabhgk. I'm 20 years old, a student at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and a girl's boyfriend, an unprofessional front-end developer.

I taught myself web development, mainly front-end development, and have a great interest in functional programming. I like design, music, and painting, which is one of the main reasons why I become a front-end developer. I usually like reading books, watching tv series, watching movies, being dazed and walking with people I like.

If you like me, you can subscribe to my blog through the watch button on this github repository, and I will notify you by email when a new blog or feature is released. Similarly, if you have any questions, you can post issues in the repository.
