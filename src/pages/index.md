Hi. I'm Gengkun He, you can call me **Ahab**, and on most websites you can find me through ahabhgk. I'm 20 years old, a student at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and a girl's boyfriend, an non-player character of front-end.

I started the front-end at `redrock team`, which is an organization of our school. I like design, music, and photographing. For now, I'm doing an internship in Bytedance.
