After a period of internship in Bytedance, let me learn a lot, but every day is very tired.Today I watched the live broadcast of the Vue Conf, which made me feel the difference between open source and companies, so I began to wonder what kind of life I wanted to live.

- A WLB job, but good pay
- Have time to participate in open source
- Have a cat with my girlfriend
- Have time for hobbies and exercise
