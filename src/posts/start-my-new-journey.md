I create another blog, yes, this is my third blog since I went to college, but I want to write something different on this blog.

[My previous posts](https://ahabhgk.github.io) have a common problem, which is I rarely express my own ideas. I wrote lots of analyze the source code posts, but now I think analyze the source code is too simple, it's an essential skill for programmers, so there is nothing to be proud of. I will move them under a subpage.

I will write my summeries, my thought, my ideas, and some of my projects at here. Please stay tuned ðŸ˜‰.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```
